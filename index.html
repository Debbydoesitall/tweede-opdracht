       <h1>An exclusive collection of plants</h1>
       <hr/>
       <p>There are a lot of different plants to cheer up your livingroom. Plants everybody knows and loves like a Sanseveria or Monstera. But did you know there's actually a market for rare and unknown plants? In the next paragraphs I'll introduce you to some of the most exculsive plants in the world.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Variegated types</h2>    
       <p>A lot of plants have beautifull green leaves, some dark and some light. But mother nature sometimes makes little mistakes. Variegated plants have a different colour mixed in their normal leaves. For instance, a Monstera Deliciosa Variegata has leaves with white spots and sometimes even complete white leaves.
